# Playtest
- 3.15 Xuesong
    - got stuck at a quest. how to get rid of the ghosts??
- 3.15 Emre:
    - I started walking downwards instead of upwards in the beginning so I never found the wisdom tree (I got it on my second try walking in the other direction).
    - I also see you didn't have time to make walking animations in all eight directions.
    - Unless a ghost comes and catches me I can't advance and it is easy to run away from ghosts anyway.
    - you might want to try limiting the running away. maybe it drains your physical energy much faster?
    - I like this game. damn I wish it had sound.
    - kumu apparently means teacher in hawaiian.
    - the spirit tree was super hard to find, which I understand.
    - but I found it in the first game without even reaching the "is this the true nature of courage? go ask the spirit tree" part.
- 3.15 Sunil:
    - complex and interesting story.
    - need more direction animation.
    - did not notice the hints at the bottom in the beginning.
    - after a while, it seems that nothing can happen. is this an endless game?
    - is ima lost in the forest and trying to escape? do not know she is there.
    - no idea of loosing health.
    - ghosts are too close to camera.
    - need music.
- 3.15: Colin:
    - I feel like the walking Down stands out quite a bit because of how smooth the walking in the other 3 directions is. It looks like she is walking backwards when you go down (D)
    - Sometimes when walking fast (spacebar) from a slow walk there’s a small hiccup
    - Without an incentive to walk slowly, I don’t really see a point to walk not going fast. Maybe adding a mechanic like The amount of physical strength or courage determines how fast she can walk, or walking fast depletes one of those two elements will give the walking fast mechanic more purpose.
    - Maybe having red dots circle her in the same way the yellow dots do which correlate with the amount of stars gathered.
    - It would be nice to full screen this or darken the background of your site. A game like this would be cool to play in the dark so the white background of your site distracts a little.
    - Maybe the stars pulse a little brighter, just for more contrast against the rest of the scene.
    - The ability to pause the game would be a nice feature as well, but I can see how it can be an intentional choice to not include that.
- 3.15: Xuesong
    - dots around ima was confusing. was it the health? star collected?
    - got stuck after collected first red star (cannot find the second red star)
    - did not understand hot to get rid of ghosts
    - did not know why ima died - indication of physical strength was not clear
