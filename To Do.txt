# Playtest
- 3.15 Xuesong
    - got stuck at a quest. how to get rid of the ghosts??
- 3.15 Emre:
    - I started walking downwards instead of upwards in the beginning so I never found the wisdom tree (I got it on my second try walking in the other direction).
    - I also see you didn't have time to make walking animations in all eight directions.
    - Unless a ghost comes and catches me I can't advance and it is easy to run away from ghosts anyway.
    - you might want to try limiting the running away. maybe it drains your physical energy much faster?
    - I like this game. damn I wish it had sound.
    - kumu apparently means teacher in hawaiian.
    - the spirit tree was super hard to find, which I understand.
    - but I found it in the first game without even reaching the "is this the true nature of courage? go ask the spirit tree" part.
- 3.15 Sunil:
    - complex and interesting story.
    - need more direction animation.
    - did not notice the hints at the bottom in the beginning.
    - after a while, it seems that nothing can happen. is this an endless game?
    - is ima lost in the forest and trying to escape? do not know she is there.
    - no idea of loosing health.
    - ghosts are too close to camera.
    - need music.
